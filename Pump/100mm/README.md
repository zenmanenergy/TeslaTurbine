## 100mm Pump

> As of 6/16/2020

These are drawings for a Tesla Pump that have 100mm diameter disks. They are based on a mixture of the patents from the 1913 stator and 1921 runner. I made some very minor design changes in the stator for ease of machining. All parts except for the axle are designed to be laser cut out of flat stock and should not require any CNC machining. Once the parts are laser cut, many of them need to be welded together to seal the joints. 

The bearing mount is designed to all the runner AND bearings to be easily removed from the stator while still press fitting the axle onto the bearings. There is no threaded nut necessary for the axle, when the bearing mounts are bolted to the stator it will (should) squeeze the disks together. The 4 holes in the bearing mount need to be tapped for an M5 bolt.

Because the diameter of this turbine is small, to get the edge up to a high enough velocity means it requires high speed bearings. The bearings in these drawings can be purchased from mcmastercarr.com They are part number: 57155K338 rated for 48,000 rpm.
