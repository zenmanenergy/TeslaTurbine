# Tesla Turbine and Pump

Nikola Tesla's turbine is a unique turbine in that it does not contain any buckets or blades. This turbine consists of a 'runner' of very thin, flat disks that are keyed to an axle. Each of the disks on the runner is seperated by the other disks with a thin star shaped spacer. Near the axle each disks contains 8 holes in them. Unlike bucket and blade style turbines, the Tesla turbine works based on a fluid's properties of viscosity and adhesion.

The turbine operates in two modes. If the axle is spun using another mechanical device, such as a motor, it becomes a pump. In this mode it sucks water into the holes near the center of the disk and ejects the fluid from the tangent of the disks. If a high velocity fluid is injecting at the tangent of the disks it becomes a turbine. In this mode the fluid causes the axle to spin at a high velocity.

## What is this repository?

This repository is made up of CAD drawings based on Tesla's patents. These drawings can be used to machine full scale turbines and pumps. Some very minor liberties have been taken in his patents primarily for ease of machinability. The current design is based on a layered approach, cutting parts with a laser cutter instead of a CNC mill. This method should dramatically reduce the time needed to machine parts. 

> `All drawings are done in metric!`

## File formate

Originally these drawings were made using Solidworks 2015. Since Solidworks is not a free CAD tool, additional file formats are included in the repository including STL and DXF. As this repository grows additional formats will be included.

## History of the Tesla Turbine

## Traditional Turbines
Most turbines work using a principle known as impulse or reaction. An impulse turbine such as a Pelton wheel or a Crossflow turbine work when a high velocity fluid strikes a bucket (Pelton wheel) or a twist blade (Crossflow turbine). A reaction turbine such as a Francic wheel or a Curtis turbine work using a curved blade that produces a lift force creating a higher speed than an impulse turbine.
